## Executive Summary

HappyCo is committed to reinforcing its competitive edge in the bustling e-commerce industry. This project centers on employing digital innovation and operational excellence to enhance customer experiences and accelerate business growth. Our data-driven strategy involves a comprehensive analysis of HappyCo's performance, identifying core strengths and areas of improvement to strategize for increased operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and sales.

## Objective

The main objective is to strengthen HappyCo's market position and increase sales by:

- Utilizing digital tools and analytics to understand current performance.
- Identifying areas for process optimization.
- Developing strategies to exceed customer expectations.

## Problem Statement

A detailed analysis of HappyCo's performance over the last three years is crucial to ascertain strengths, pinpoint areas requiring enhancement, and unveil growth opportunities. Insights gained will drive strategic decisions to boost operational efficiency, elevate customer satisfaction, and augment sales.

## Methodology

Our analytical approach integrated various digital tools:

- **draw.io**: Used for initial data modeling to visualize each business process.
- **Power BI and Power Query**: These tools were essential for the practical implementation of models. Power Query managed data ingestion, cleansing, and transformation, while Power BI unified the business process models into an all-encompassing analytical framework. Power BIâ€™s advanced analytics, AI capabilities, and reporting features facilitated the creation of insightful data visualizations.

## Key Findings

The analysis uncovered:

- A solid customer base within the low to middle-income brackets.
- Top-selling products and a notable revenue dip in Q4 2017 due to inventory issues.
- Delivery delays in 57% of orders, specifically standard deliveries.
- A concentration of high-performing employees in certain departments, indicating a need for balanced workload distribution.

These findings underscore the importance of prioritizing customer satisfaction, inventory accuracy, and operational efficiency.

## Conclusion

Our in-depth analysis revealed substantial opportunities for improving customer satisfaction, inventory management, and operational efficiency. Addressing the challenges related to product shortages, delivery delays, and employee workload distribution is paramount.
